- Basic authentication
- Simple client-server architecture
- Error handling and logging

## Requirements

- C compiler (e.g., gcc)
- POSIX-compliant system (Linux, macOS)
- Network connectivity (TCP/IP)


## Learning Objectives

- Understand socket programming in C
- Explore file system operations over a network
- Practice building robust client-server applications
